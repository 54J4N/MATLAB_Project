MATLAB script that demonstrates a matrix transformation based on specified conditions. The transformation involves:

Computing the natural logarithm of elements in the matrix that are greater than 1.
Adding 5 to each element that is less than or equal to 1.
The repository includes the original problem statement, the MATLAB code used to solve the problem, and a visual representation of the results using a plot.

Problem Statement
Consider the matrix 
A=[3,5,−4,−8,−1,33,−17,6,−9]

Using a for loop with conditional statements, write a program that generates matrix 
𝐵
B by:

Computing the natural logarithm of the elements of 
𝐴
A whose value is greater than 1.
Adding 5 to each element of 
𝐴
A that is equal to or less than 1.

#MatLab Code: <matrixab.m>
% Define the matrix A
A = [3 5 -4 -8 -1 33 -17 6 -9];

% Initialize matrix B with the same size as A
B = zeros(size(A));

% Iterate through each element of A
for j = 1:length(A)
    if A(j) > 1
        B(j) = log(A(j));  % Compute natural logarithm for elements greater than 1
    else
        B(j) = A(j) + 5;   % Add 5 for elements less than or equal to 1
    end
end

% Display the result
disp('Matrix B:');
disp(B);

Generated Matrix 𝐵
After running the MATLAB code, the generated matrix B is:
B=[1.0986,1.6094,1,−3,4,3.4965,−12,1.7918,−4]

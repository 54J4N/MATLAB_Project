# Linear Equation Solver with MATLAB

## Overview

This MATLAB script demonstrates how to solve a system of linear equations using MATLAB. It generates a random coefficient matrix \(A\) and a constant vector \(b\), solves the system \(Ax = b\) for the solution vector \(x\), and saves the solution to a MAT file.

## Usage

To use this script:

1. Open MATLAB or Octave.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a new script file.
3. Run the script.
4. The solution vector \(x\) will be displayed in the MATLAB command window.
5. The solution vector will also be saved to a MAT file named `solution.mat`.

## Purpose

This script is useful for:

- Understanding how to solve systems of linear equations using MATLAB.
- Testing MATLAB's performance on solving large systems of linear equations.
- Saving solutions for further analysis or use in other MATLAB projects.

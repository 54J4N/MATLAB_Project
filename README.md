## Projects Overview
In this repository, you will find MATLAB scripts and applications that demonstrate the powerful capabilities of MATLAB for solving complex mathematical problems and performing sophisticated data analysis and visualization.

### Current Projects Include:
- **System Performance Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of CPU and RAM usage.
  
- **Linear Equation Solver**: Solving large systems of linear equations efficiently.
  
- **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**: Develops a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using MATLAB. It utilizes advanced data processing, machine learning algorithms, and                                                  real-time visualization to analyze network traffic data. The goal is to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate cyber attacks and                                                   ensure network security. This system processes large datasets to classify network traffic as normal or potentially harmful, using                                                          MATLAB's robust computational and visualization capabilities.
- **Matrix-Transformation-Logarithm**: A MATLAB script that demonstrates a matrix transformation based on specific conditions. The transformation involves: Computing the natural   
                                        logarithm of elements in the matrix that are greater than 1. Adding 5 to each element that is less than or equal to 1.
                                        Problem: Consider the matrix A: A=[3,5,‚àí4,‚àí8,‚àí1,33,‚àí17,6,‚àí9] Using a for loop with conditional statements, write a program that generates matrix 
                                        ùêµ by:  Computing the natural logarithm of the elements of ùê¥ whose value is greater than 1. Adding 5 to each element of  that is equal to or less 
                                        than 1.
